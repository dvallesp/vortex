# ``vortex`` code
### Implements Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition for an AMR velocity field.
#### Developed by Susana Planelles, Vicent Quilis and David Vallés-Pérez

The folder ./src contains the source code, written in FORTRAN and parallellised according to the OpenMP standard.
The reader.f may must be changed for different simulation. Using it, it may be in principle easy to apply it to simulation codes different than ``MASCLET``.
